# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello, I'm Samik Bhushal, a passionate developer with experience in building web and mobile applications. This repository showcases a collection of my projects, each demonstrating my skills in various technologies.
### PROJECTS
## GiftDelivery App
The Gift Delivery Application project is designed to provide a user-friendly platform for ordering and managing gift deliveries. Developed using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Cordova, the app integrates a cloud-hosted database and hybrid deployment for web and Android platforms.
You can explore the code for the **GiftDelivery App** here:

## CRUD App (Coming Soon)

In addition to the GiftDelivery App, I'm currently working on a **CRUD application**. This app allows users to perform basic operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. It uses **React** for the frontend and **Zustand** for state management, showcasing my skills in modern web development.

**Stay tuned** for updates on the CRUD app as I continue to build and improve it!
