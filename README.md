# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello, I'm Samik Bhushal, a passionate developer with experience in building web and mobile applications. This repository showcases a collection of my projects, each demonstrating my skills in various technologies.

## GiftDelivery App

One of the key projects in my portfolio is the **GiftDelivery App**, where I developed an application for managing and sending gifts. This project was built using **[Technology Used]**, and it serves as a great example of my ability to create fully functional applications from the ground up.

You can explore the code for the **GiftDelivery App** here:

## CRUD App (Coming Soon)

In addition to the GiftDelivery App, I'm currently working on a **CRUD application**. This app allows users to perform basic operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. It uses **React** for the frontend and **Zustand** for state management, showcasing my skills in modern web development.

**Stay tuned** for updates on the CRUD app as I continue to build and improve it!
